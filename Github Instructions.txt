to clone repo:
git clone https://github.com/cgilbert05/Project-Team-Blue.git
 (you will need to right click in your terminal to paste)

to create your branch:
go into Project-Team-Blue (should show as master)
git checkout -b (type your last name)

git checkout (master or branch name)


I should be able to accept the commit once you have done these items. I will be rewatching the class video as well as doing some more research on Github and will come up with some best practices. I'll post these to the repo once complete. If anyone needs help shoot me a message on slack or I can help tomorrow night at class.
